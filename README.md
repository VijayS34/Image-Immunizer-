**Image Immunizer**
**An Image Tamper Resilient Multi-Task Learning Scheme for Image Lossless Auto-Recovery**

**Abstract**
Digital images on social networking sites are vulnerable to various tampering attacks, which can compromise security and privacy. The Image Immunizer project addresses these challenges by introducing a robust scheme for image tampering resistance and lossless auto-recovery using Vaccinator and Invertible Neural Network (INN), a deep learning approach. This project leverages multitask learning to train the network with four key modules: image vaccination, consistency validation, tampered pixel classification, and self-recovery to closely resemble the original image.
