# 📸 Image Immunizer

### An Image Tamper-Resilient Multi-Task Learning Scheme for Lossless Auto-Recovery

---

## 📝 Overview

Digital images shared on social networking platforms are prone to tampering and unauthorized alterations. The **Image Immunizer** project introduces a robust solution to combat image tampering and ensure the authenticity of shared content. This project leverages **Vaccinator** and **Invertible Neural Network (INN)** for tampering resistance and lossless auto-recovery.

## 🎯 Aim and Objectives

### Aim
To significantly enhance the security and integrity of images shared on social media platforms, ensuring their authenticity.

### Objectives
- 🛠️ Effectively train the network to enhance its resilience against real-world threats.
- 🧬 Develop the Cyber Vaccinator for Image Immunization.
- 🛡️ Implement the Vaccine Validator for Media Distinction.
- 🔍 Establish binary masks for object contours.
- 🔄 Design Forward Pass for Tamper Detection.
- 📌 Develop a Localizer for Tampered Area Detection.
- ♻️ Create Backward Pass for Image Self-Recovery.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Simulate Adversarial Attacks for Effective Network Training.
- 🚀 Encourage Image Self-Recovery Mechanisms.
- 🔐 Achieve Proactive Image Immunization and Restoration.
